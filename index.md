## Overview 

### What is Contained
Contained is an open source project which provides a way to build highly modular web applications that can be build across numerous programming languages and frameworks. 

All the apps in Contained Platform are built out of smaller modular components that can operate on it's own or part of the bigger system. Idea is that you will build self "contained" small modules that can be reused in other projects and even in other programming languages and platforms.
